User guide for Kinematic Draping App

This program predicts the draped pattern of a rectangular fabric on various molds of the from z=F(x,y).
The program was developed specifically for wind turbine blade molds.
Currently the following molds are implemented, but any point cloud can be 
processed to a valid mold definition:
1) Hemisphere: A hemisphere mold as a classical benchmark.
2) BladeLike: Mold mimicing a blade mold.
3) Flat: Flat table.

The draping pattern is calculated in two steps:
1) Determine generators that span the entire ply and populate with nodes.
2) Calculate the cells spanned by the generators such that their side lengths
   are equal to the chosen discretization.

The inputs are (which can either be defined in an input file or through the GUI):
- d: the discretization, i.e. cell side length
- Grid: the number of nodes in the transverse and longitudinal direction.
  N.B.: d and Grid control the fabric size.
- Org: the origin point (only applicable when two goedesic lines are used as generators).
- OrgNode / OrgNodePct: The origin node, i.e. located at the intersection of the 
  generators either expressed as the node indices or the percentage of the Grid.
- Ang: Angle between longitudinal geodesic generator and y-axis (only applicable when
  two geodesic lines are used as the generators).
- PreShear: Changing the initial 90 deg. angle between generators at the origin 
  (only applicable when two geodesics are used or a geodesic is used for the transverse
  direction). 

- Longitudinal draping control: Choose between a steering curve or a geodesic.
- Transverse draping control: Choose between a steering curve or a geodesic. 

If the steering curve is selected in any of the above, it must be defined either as 
"Abs", i.e. in absolute values (in the mold coordinate system) or relative to a 
mold edge. For the longutidinal steering points, the definition can be relative to:
- Right edge ("Right" option).
- Left edge ("Left" option).
Pairs of (x,y)-coordinates define the offsetting. The y-coordinate defines the
location on the reference curve (2D Euclidean distance from 1st point on ref. curve)
and the x-coordinate defines the offset away from the reference curve.

And the transverse steering points can be defined relative to the
- Bottom edge ("Bottom" option).

As mentioned the Org and Ang are not always applicable as input, e.g. when
defining the generators as steering curves.

Regarding Ang:
- If a steering curve is used in the longitudinal direction and a geodesic
  is used in the transverse direction, the geodesic will be 90 deg. apart from 
  the steering curve. Use the PreShear to change this.
- If two steering curves are used as generators they determine the angle.

Regarding Org:
- If a steering curve is used in the longitudinal direction and a geodesic
  is used in the transverse direction, the origin is taken as the y-coordinate
  (2nd component) of Org. The x-coordinate (1st component) is not applicable.
- If two steering curves are used as generators, the origin is taken as their
  intersection.

Input limitations:
- It is not possible to define a geodesic as the longitudinal generator in combination
  with a steering curve as the transverse generator.
