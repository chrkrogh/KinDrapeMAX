The program can analyze and optimize the draping pattern on a mold using 
a kinematic draping model and the built-in MATLAB implementation of 
genetic algorithm, i.e. the function ga. It is intended for wind turbine 
blade production, i.e. where multiple roll-widths or courses of fabric 
are necessary to cover the mold and where the mold is more or less 
rectangular. It can, however, also analyze a single ply on any smooth 
surface. Please see the user guide for more information on how to run it.

The program was used to generate the results described in the journal paper:

Below is an example of output generated with the program: five courses of fabric draped in a mold and colored based on shear angle.
